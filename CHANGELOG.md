## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-28

### 🐛 Fixed

- **WSL pipe syntax errors:** Fixed WSL commands failing when using pipes (`|`) on Windows
  - ❌ Before: `wsl gh pr diff 149 | head -100` → `'head' is not recognized`
  - ✅ After: System prompt now guides to use `wsl bash -c "command | pipe"`
  - Affects: `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find`, and complex `jq` filters with pipes
  
- **Loop Detection false positives:** Loop detection now correctly identifies SAME command failing multiple times
  - Previously triggered on different exploratory operations (404s, compatibility errors)
  - Now normalizes commands and excludes expected errors (404, command not found)
  - Only triggers when SAME base command fails ≥3 times consecutively
  
- **Task Status classification:** Windows compatibility errors now correctly distinguished from expected errors
  - ❌ Before: Classified compatibility issues as "expected errors (not blockers)"
  - ✅ After: Shows "Task completed with warnings" + specific compatibility guidance
  - Helps identify issues that need system prompt fixes vs normal operational errors

### ✨ Added

- **Comprehensive PR Review Workflow:** 5-step mandatory review before merge
  - Step 1: Validate PR status & checks
  - Step 2: Review comments (CodeRabbit, reviewers)
  - Step 3: Review code changes (does it solve the problem?)
  - Step 4: Impact analysis (breaking changes, affected files)
  - Step 5: Final decision & summary (present summary, wait for confirmation)

### 📚 Documentation

- Added `docs/wsl-pipes-fix.md` (187 lines) - WSL pipe syntax issue and solution
- Added `TRACE-ANALYSIS-IMPROVEMENTS.md` (381 lines) - Complete trace analysis report
- Added `docs/wsl-integration.md` (500+ lines) - WSL integration guide
- Added WSL pipe syntax examples in system prompt
- Updated loop detection to exclude compatibility errors
- Enhanced task status messages with compatibility warnings

### 🔧 Internal

- Improved error classification: compatibility vs blocking vs expectable
- Command normalization for accurate loop detection
- Added tool arguments tracking for better error analysis

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-27 - CRITICAL SECURITY RELEASE

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This release fixes 3 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities. **Update immediately.**

### 🚨 CRITICAL Security Fixes

#### Fixed - Vulnerability #1: --admin Flag Used Without Permission
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 8.5)
- **Impact:** Agent bypassed branch protection without user permission
- **Fix:** \`--admin\` flag now requires EXPLICIT user permission
- **Before:** \`merge the PRs\` → used \`--admin\` automatically
- **After:** \`merge the PRs\` → explains blocking, suggests \`--auto\`
- **To use --admin:** User must say "use --admin" or "bypass branch protection"

#### Fixed - Vulnerability #2: Repository Rulesets Modified/Deleted Without Permission
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.1)
- **Impact:** Agent deleted/modified repository security settings
- **Fix:** Modifying/deleting rulesets now FORBIDDEN without explicit permission

#### Fixed - Vulnerability #3: GitHub Token Exposed in Logs
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.8)
- **Impact:** Authentication tokens exposed in command logs
- **Fix:** Tokens never exposed, always use \`gh\` CLI for auth

### ✨ Added

- Task Status Intelligence (smart error classification)
- Loop Detection (detects ≥3x same error)
- GitHub PR Merge Workflow (3-step verification)
- Cross-Platform Compatibility (Windows jq syntax, 404 handling)

### 📚 Documentation

- 2,150+ lines of security and feature documentation
- SECURITY-CRITICAL-FIXES.md (800+ lines)
- github-merge-workflow.md (500+ lines)
- task-status-intelligence.md (457 lines)
- loop-detection.md (400+ lines)

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Agent will NO LONGER use \`--admin\` without explicit permission
- Agent will NO LONGER modify repository rulesets automatically
