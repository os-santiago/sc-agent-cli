# Keyboard Shortcuts

Quick reference for keyboard shortcuts and helpful commands in SC CLI.

## Visual Guide

Every time you're about to type a message, you'll see a helpful hint line:

```
↑↓:history │ Ctrl+C:exit │ /help:commands │ /permissions:setup │ /pre-approved:quick-setup
┌─ You ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ hello, how can you help?
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The hint line appears **before** your input box, reminding you of available shortcuts and commands.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### ↑ / ↓ (Arrow Keys)

**Navigate through your message history**

Just like in bash/terminal:
- **↑** (Up Arrow) - Previous message
- **↓** (Down Arrow) - Next message

**Example:**
```
You: create a new component
[Press ↑]
You: create a new component  ← Your last message appears
```

Useful for:
- Repeating similar commands
- Editing previous prompts
- Avoiding retyping

---

### Ctrl+C

**Exit the chat session immediately**

Quick way to exit without typing "exit" or "quit".

**Example:**
```
You: working on something...
[Press Ctrl+C]

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  👋 Goodbye!
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Alternative ways to exit:**
- Type `exit`
- Type `quit`

## Tips

### Use Tab Completion (Not Yet Implemented)

Currently commands must be typed fully. Tab completion is planned for future releases.

---

### Combine Shortcuts

1. **↑** to recall previous command
2. Edit it
3. **Enter** to send
4. **Ctrl+C** when done

---

### Command History Persists

Your message history stays during the entire session. It resets when you:
- Exit the chat
- Use `/clear`

Commands (starting with `/`) are **not** added to history.

---

## Common Workflows

1. Start chat: scc
2. Type: /pre-approved
3. Answer questions
4. Start working
```

---

### Switch Models Mid-Session

```
1. Press ↑ to recall last prompt
2. Type: /model

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows (PowerShell)

All shortcuts work as documented.

---

### WSL / Linux

All shortcuts work as documented.

---

### macOS

---

## Troubleshooting

### Arrow keys don't work

**Problem:** ↑↓ don't navigate history

**Solution:** This is a Node.js readline feature and should work automatically. If not:
- Make sure you're using Node.js 18+
- Try restarting your terminal

---

### Ctrl+C doesn't exit cleanly

**Problem:** Session doesn't exit or shows errors

**Solution:**
- Try typing `exit` instead
- Press Ctrl+C twice quickly
- Close the terminal window

---

### Commands not working

**Problem:** `/help` or other commands don't work

**Solution:**
- Make sure to include the `/` prefix
- Commands are case-insensitive: `/HELP` works
- Type exactly as shown (no spaces before `/`)
